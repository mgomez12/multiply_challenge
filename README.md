# multiply_challenge

My submission for the technical challenge.

The main package is TCSBot, and the script I used to test is test.py. Please note that test.py is not actually a functional robot simulator, I just used it to test input/output handling including fake errors, so it purposefully has wonky behavior. However, the main package should be fully functional and would send out valid commands for valid inputs.
